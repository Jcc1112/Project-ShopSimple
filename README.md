<h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
With the rise in environmental pollution, monitoring air quality has become crucial for ensuring public health and safety. This project presents an Arduino-based Air Quality Monitoring System that utilizes the MQ-135 gas sensor, DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and an I2C LCD 16x2 display for real-time air quality assessment. The system is built on a breadboard for easy prototyping and modularity. The MQ-135 sensor detects harmful gases such as carbon dioxide (CO₂), ammonia (NH₃), benzene, and smoke, while the DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity to provide a comprehensive environmental analysis. The collected data is processed by an Arduino Uno, which then displays the air quality metrics on an I2C 16x2 LCD screen, ensuring a user-friendly interface. This low-cost, portable system is suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications, making it an efficient tool for air quality monitoring in homes, offices, and urban areas.

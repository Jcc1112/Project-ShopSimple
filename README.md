<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
ArduiCom is a solution for Arduino learners to gain direct knowledge about Arduino and its components. This will eliminate the need to search multiple websites and scattered information, which can be incorrect, and may confuse the learner. This enables the community of developers to research and gain proper, legitimate knowledge for the particular project they are researching or preparing. Additionally, there will be a marketplace featuring all high-quality Arduino components. 

ArduiCom is a space for curious minds and meticulous investigators, basically for those who want to learn or are actively learning about Arduino and its uses, enabling them to learn new things. It is also for those who are systematically gathering and evaluating information that leads to a process of uncovering insights, basically research on Arduino.

ArduiCom will be app-based and will be created using knowledge of basic coding and certain projects created visually using TinkerCAD, and also physical projects. The Marketplace will have good quality components with a link to Amazon or Flipkart, with its price mentioned, so it could be purchased.

1. **Theoretical Background**<br>
The idea behind this project was to provide help to curious Arduino learners by offering a way to gain knowledge and explore Arduino through acquiring the necessary learning related data all in one place, ensuring ease for learners. Also, help the meticulous minds to explore and use their existing knowledge to create improved projects. This will also help with learning new facts and discovering a wide range of component combinations.  
     There are similar websites like the Arduino Community and Projecthub, which provide knowledge, but on both the Community and  Projecthub, knowledge is not direct, but is scattered all over the place, making it hard for learners/users to have proper knowledge of that particular component or Code. 

2. **Objectives of the Project**<br>
  Few Of the objectives are listed below
    - To enhance Arduino-related knowledge
    - To enhance one’s Skills
    - To make Arduino-related Information more accessible
    - To encourage more people to use the Arduino Microcontroller
    - To help with project-driven learning

3. **Purpose, Scope & Applicability of the Project**<br>

   **a. Purpose** <br>
      - This project intends to try and get all Arduino learning related data to one place, which will ensure ease of use for the learner, not having to visit several websites for a piece of information or code of a particular Arduino compound. There will be a marketplace also because some compounds that are sold worldwide are sometimes defective, or some components are unusable due to constant breaking. 

    **b. Scope**
      - Limitation: ArduiCom will not be with the Arduino community, which is open source. ArduiCom will just be a way to explore and acquire knowledge, as it is a mobile app, coding will not be possible, and also, Tinkercad scaling on a mobile phone is still a bit of a problem. 
      - Accessibility: This project will be quite accessible as it has been created with some older Android versions in mind, which include starting from Android 7.0(Nougat) to the latest, the User Interface (UI) is simple and easy to navigate. 

    **c. Applicability**
      - ArduiCom can be used for learning and research based on Arduino, which will help users find what they are looking for faster and make it more interesting for new beginners to learn and create their own creations based on the information. This will help people develop more skills.
